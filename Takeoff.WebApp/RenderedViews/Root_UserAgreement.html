  <h1>Takeoff's Terms of Use Agreement</h1>
    


<p>This Agreement was last revised on Oct 22, 2011.</p>

<p>Welcome to Takeoffvideo.com, a website and online service of Takeoff, Inc. ("Takeoff" "we", or "us"). This page explains the terms by which you may use our service. By accessing or using the Takeoff services, websites and software provided through or in connection with the service ("Service"), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement"), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.  </p>
<p>Except as specified below, we reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time and without notice. If we do this, we will post the amended Agreement on this page and indicate at the top of the page the date the Agreement was last revised. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").  </p>
<p>IF YOU ARE USING OR OPENING AN ACCOUNT WITH TAKEOFF ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY, ENTITY, OR ORGANIZATION (COLLECTIVELY, THE "SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION") THEN YOU AGREE, REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT: (I) YOU ARE AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION WITH THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION TO THIS AGREEMENT; (II) YOU have read THIS AGREEMENT; (III) YOU understand THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, (IV) YOU agree to THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT on behalf of SUCH SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION, (V) ACCESS TO THE SERVICE SHALL BE LIMITED TO USERS AUTHORIZED BY SUCH SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION TO ACCESS THE SERVICE, (VI) EACH SUCH AUTHORIZED USER SHALL HAVE A UNIQUE USERNAME AND PASSWORD COMBINATION TO ACCESS THE SERVICE (A "LOGIN"), AND (VII) EACH LOGIN WILL BE USED ONLY BY SUCH AUTHORIZED USER TO WHOM IT WAS FIRST ASSIGNED AND BY NO OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING NO OTHER EMPLOYEE OR AGENT OF THE SUBSCRIBING ORGANIZATION.</p>

<h2>Use of Our Service</h2>

<p>Takeoff provides online environments that allow you to plan and execute production of video projects. The company's software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering enhances stages of video production, from asset sharing to preview and approval.  </p>
<p>Takeoff grants you permission to use the Service as set forth in this Agreement, provided that: (i) you will not copy, distribute, or disclose any part of the Service in any medium; (ii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Service other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Service for its intended purpose; (iii) you will be fully responsible for all use of your account and actions that take place using your account; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  </p>
<p>Takeoff may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or otherwise refuse to permit your access to the Service or any part of the Service without notice and liability for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if, in Takeoff's sole determination, you violate any part of the Agreement, including the following prohibited actions: (i) interfering with, compromising the system integrity or security of, or deciphering any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (ii) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure or otherwise exceeding limits placed on use of the Service at any time by Takeoff; (iii) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, timebombs, Trojan horses, cancelbots, or other harmful or disruptive codes, components, devices, or software agents through the Service; (iv) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity, or misrepresenting the source or content of information transmitted through the Service; (v) interfering with the proper working of the Service or others' enjoyment of the Service; (vi) using the Service or the Takeoff website(s) in any unlawful manner, or in any other manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the Service or the Takeoff website(s); (vii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service; (viii) using any robot, spider, scraper, script, or other automated technology to access the Service for any purpose without our express written permission; (ix) gaining unauthorized access to the Service, its user accounts, computer systems or networks through unauthorized means such as hacking or password mining; (x) reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling or otherwise attempting to discover the source code of the Service, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation; or (xi) renting, leasing, loaning, time sharing, reselling, sublicensing, distributing or otherwise transferring the Service to any third party or using the Service for any purpose other than your own noncompetitive internal personal or business use. Upon termination for any reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.  </p>

<h2>Member Accounts</h2>

<p>You do not have to register in order to visit Takeoff. To access certain features of the Service, though, including creating a team for your video production (a "Production") and/or collaborating on an existing Project by joining a "Production", you will need to register with Takeoff and create a "Member" account. Your account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.  </p>
<p>You may use your Account Settings to control your Member Profile and how other Members communicate with you. By providing Takeoff with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may not opt out of Service-related emails. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by contacting the Takeoff support department at support@Takeoffvideo.com. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.  </p>
<p>You may never use another Member's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Takeoff immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Takeoff will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you shall be liable for the losses of Takeoff or others due to such unauthorized use. </p>
<p>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Takeoff servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names and e-mail addresses, from the Service nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Takeoff may access, preserve and disclose your account information and related contents if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce this Agreement; (c) respond to claims that any information violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Takeoff, its users, or the public. </p>

<h2>Subscription Terms</h2>
<p>The Service is offered on a per month subscription-basis (the "Subscription Service"); provided, that Takeoff may in its discretion offer the Service, or certain features of the Service, on a free-of-charge basis. If you open a Member account for the Subscription Service, you hereby agree to pay all charges to your account, including applicable taxes, in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable.  </p>
<p>Payment Methods. Authorization to charge your chosen payment method account will remain in effect until you cancel or modify your subscription preferences within the Subscription Service, terminate this authorization, or change your selected payment method; provided, however, that such notice will not affect charges submitted before Takeoff could reasonably act. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you ordered the applicable service. You agree that charges may be accumulated as incurred and may be submitted as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of the applicable billing cycle.  </p>
<p>Fee Adjustments. Takeoff reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fees or charges for the Subscription Service we provide, and to institute new fees, charges, or terms for the Service effective upon prior notice to our Users and/or posting on the Takeoff website(s), including without limitation for any part of the Service that may have been offered free-of-charge. Any changes to fees will apply only on a prospective basis. If you do not agree to any such changes to fees, charges, or terms, your sole remedy is to cancel your subscription. Failure to cancel your account before the effective date of such new fees, charges or terms will constitute acceptance of such fee change. Fees paid for any Subscription Service term are paid in advance and are not refundable in whole or in part unless permitted under these Terms of Use. If you have a balance due on any Subscription Service account, you agree that Takeoff can charge these unpaid fees to any payment method that you have previously provided.  </p>

<h2>Renewal</h2>
<p>Your Subscription Service will be automatically renewed and your credit card account (or other payment method account) will be charged as follows without further authorization from you: (i) every month for monthly subscriptions;  or (ii) such other periodic rate you have selected from among the existing or future options offered on the Service.</p>
<p>For monthly accounts or other accounts with a periodic subscription cycle of less than one year, there are no refunds for cancellations for periodic charges. For monthly subscriptions, you must cancel your subscription before the start date of the next billing cycle. </p>

<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property Rights" means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefor and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Takeoff takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other Users or third parties post or send over the Service. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or otherwise make available or access through your use of the Service, is solely your responsibility. Takeoff is not responsible for any public display, disclosure, misuse or mishandling of your User Content. You understand that when using the Service, you may be exposed to User Content submitted from numerous sources and Takeoff is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, or safety of any User Content, or for the infringement of the intellectual property rights of any party as a result of, or relating to, the submission of any User Content. You further understand that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Takeoff with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold Takeoff, its owners/operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Service. Takeoff does not endorse any User Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Takeoff expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content.

<p>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Takeoff without restriction.  </p>

<h2>General  </h2>
<p>A. Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Takeoff, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the state of New Jersey, United States of America. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New Jersey, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Takeoff that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Middlesex County, New Jersey. You and Takeoff agree that any cause of action against Takeoff arising out of or related to the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. <br />
B. Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. <br />
C. Notification Procedures. Takeoff may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website(s), as determined by Takeoff in our sole discretion. Takeoff reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. <br />
D. Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any other legal notices and agreements published by Takeoff via the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Takeoff concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.  <br />
E. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Takeoff's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  </p>
